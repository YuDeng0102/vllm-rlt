## About

**vllm-rlt** is a standalone inference and serving engine for recurrent language
models, with native support for **ByteDance/Ouro-1.4B** and
**Nanbeige/Nanbeige4.2-3B**. It brings continuous
batching to individual recurrent loops, allowing requests at different loop
depths to share a batch as they work toward their next token.

Recurrent models reuse a shared transformer core multiple times per token.
With adaptive early exit, different tokens can require different amounts of
computation. vllm-rlt schedules work at these loop boundaries and manages KV
state by recurrence depth, so requests can leave and refill the batch without
waiting for an entire cohort to finish.

The project follows a vLLM-style engine organization and implements runtime
ideas from **Continuous Depth Batching (CDB)**, described in
[Depth-adaptive Inference of Looped Language Models via Continuous Depth
Batching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2608.09444) by Kristian Schwethelm, Daniel
Rückert, and Georgios Kaissis (2026). It runs independently and does not require
vLLM to be installed. See [Citation](#citation) for the paper's BibTeX entry.

## Highlights

- **Two native models:** Ouro-1.4B with fixed-depth or learned early-exit
  decoding, and Nanbeige4.2-3B with fixed two-loop inference.
- **Measured decode speed:** synchronous self-speculation reached **236.45
  committed tokens/s**, versus **154.23 tokens/s** for native fixed-depth async
  decoding (**~1.53×**) on the historical Ouro-1.4B workload below.[^decode-benchmark]
- **Loop-aware runtime:** continuous batching, depth-aware paged KV, and opt-in
  prefix caching, CUDA Graphs, self-speculation, and single-host prefill/decode
  disaggregation.
- **Ready-to-use interfaces:** Python API, CLI, and streaming OpenAI-compatible
  completions.

**[v0.1.0 is experimental](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/vllm-rlt/releases/tag/v0.1.0).**
Start with synchronous execution. Async execution with preemption can produce
incorrect outputs ([#109](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/vllm-rlt/pull/109));
async self-speculation has unresolved worker-failure and cleanup issues
([#115](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/vllm-rlt/pull/115)). See the release notes
for supported combinations and limitations.

[^decode-benchmark]: Historical medians of five trials on one NVIDIA H20-3e:
    Ouro-1.4B BF16, Triton 3.6.0, eager execution, LAST_EXITED KV,
    64-token prompt / 32-token output, concurrency 8, draft depth 2 / target
    depth 4, K=2. Committed-decode timing excludes prefill, the first output
    token, and HTTP/client overhead. [Full protocol and measurements](https://github.com/ThinkFlowLab/vllm-rlt/blob/ea3f74c5cd9c280086195d996a4f9fbcf82bc04b/docs/async-speculative.md#matched-bf16-measurements)
    used runtime `d977817d4e174cbc2fcc9aa7ef5893c35da2ec89`; these are
    workload-specific results, not a fresh v0.1.0 benchmark or production guarantee.

## Features

- **Loop-level continuous batching.** Mix requests at different recurrence
  depths, with refill and no-refill scheduling, chunked prefill, dynamic
  arrivals, and cancellation.
- **Adaptive computation.** Run fixed-depth decoding or use Ouro's trained
  early-exit gate, with per-request loop bounds and exit thresholds.
- **Depth-aware paged KV cache.** LAST-EXITED and SHARED layouts, automatic
  CUDA cache sizing, and optional prefix caching, incremental page allocation,
  priority scheduling, and preemption with CPU state snapshots.
- **Configurable GPU execution.** Triton and FlashAttention backends, asynchronous
  scheduling, multiple CUDA streams, reusable buffers, and CUDA Graph capture
  of decode recurrent cores.
- **Offline and online inference.** A Python API, a command-line interface,
  and an OpenAI-compatible completions endpoint with streaming, greedy decoding,
  and seeded top-k/top-p sampling.
- **Prefill/decode disaggregation.** Separate prefill and decode worker pools
  across GPUs on one host, with NIXL KV transfer and overlap between chunked
  prefill computation and transfer.

The default runtime uses synchronous execution; Ouro uses its original gate.
Advanced execution and cache features are opt-in; see the guides below for
supported combinations.

## How It Works

Full-depth prefill produces the first token through the coda. Each subsequent
token passes through the prelude and a variable number of recurrent loops
before sampling. Requests at different loop depths can share the same batch.

```

The diagram shows logical token flow; asynchronous execution can overlap
stages. See the [runtime guide](docs/cdb_runtime.md) for scheduling, exit policies,
and depth-aware KV caching.

The animation follows one request: four-loop prefill produces `y₀`, then
processing `y₀` with a two-loop adaptive exit produces `y₁`. Each loop reuses
the same 24-layer transformer core. Gate scores and timing are illustrative;
the default `exit_threshold=1.0` uses four loops.

## Getting Started

Requires **Python 3.10+** and **PyTorch 2.5+**. For GPU inference, use Linux with
an NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA-enabled PyTorch installation compatible with your
hardware.

With your environment activated, use uv from the repository root to install
the project (text, serving, and Triton
support are included):

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

For a fresh machine, follow the [step-by-step user guide](docs/launching.md):
create an environment, download the model, start the server, and send your first
request. The guide also covers command-line inference and the Python API. Browse the [documentation](docs/README.md) for runtime
configuration, optional backends, and design notes.

## Performance Baselines

The current performance baselines are recorded in
[PR #30: depth-aware KV and asynchronous execution](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/pull/30)
and [PR #31: prefill/decode disaggregation](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/pull/31).
These reports provide the reference measurements for subsequent runtime work.

### Single-GPU runtime

PR #30 evaluates feature stacking on Ouro-1.4B BF16 on B300. The figure
shows **relative engine end-to-end throughput** for 1,024-token inputs at
concurrency 1, 32, and 128. Each curve is normalized to its own FA4 baseline;
the legend includes absolute baseline throughput. Triton is excluded.

![PR 30 feature stacking: end-to-end output throughput at concurrency 1, 32, and 128 with cumulative runtime features](docs/assets/performance/pr30-feature-stacking.png)

P1–P8 progressively add early exit, delayed exit, asynchronous scheduling,
multiple streams, static buffers, padding, and decode recurrent-core CUDA
Graphs. The shaded pair is the separate **FA4 split=1** rerun, comparing CUDA
Graphs with and without resident asynchronous state. Its normalization to the original
FA4 baseline is a cross-campaign comparison; only the shaded pair is matched.

Values are medians of three trials, with 128 output tokens per request and
2×concurrency requests using closed-loop replacement. Timing includes prefill
and drain time, excluding HTTP, tokenization, loading, and warmup. The vertical
axis is linear. P2→P3 changes the exit policy;
output and exit-depth differences remain unresolved in some configurations.
See [PR #30](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/pull/30) for decode-only
results, latency tables, and the full protocol.

### Four-GPU serving

PR #31 compares four independent replicas with disaggregated prefill (P) and
decode (D) pools. Each configuration uses four GPUs, Ouro-1.4B BF16, FA4
split=1, asynchronous scheduling, CUDA Graphs, and the new KV/scheduling
features. Each phase replays 512 ShareGPT prompts with 128 output tokens.

Each figure compares all four configurations against **four replicas = 100%**.
Bar labels show the PR-reported percentage changes. Higher throughput is better;
lower latency is better. At 4 and 8 req/s, **2P2D retains 99.0% and 97.5% of
baseline throughput**, while reducing TTFT by **13.3% and 25.8%** and ITL by
**53.5% and 47.9%**, respectively.

![PR 31 at 4 requests per second: all four deployments and five metrics, with changes relative to four replicas](docs/assets/performance/pr31-pd-serving-4rps.png)

![PR 31 at 8 requests per second: all four deployments and five metrics, with changes relative to four replicas](docs/assets/performance/pr31-pd-serving-8rps.png)

Bars average the initial and immediate-replay phases equally; latency values
are averages of phase percentiles, not pooled percentiles. TTFT measures time
to first token, TPOT average time per subsequent token, ITL individual token
intervals, and E2E request completion latency. Some cases use isolated reruns
while others were measured with concurrent configurations on the same host;
see [PR #31](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/pull/31) for the full protocol.

In this workload, 1P3D improves generation latency at the cost of TTFT, while
2P2D improves all reported latency metrics with slightly lower throughput.
These are fixed-arrival-rate measurements, not peak-capacity results, and do
not isolate the benefit of individual cache or scheduling features.

### Validation

See the [runtime validation and context/concurrency results](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/pull/30)
and [GSM8K evaluation guide](docs/accuracy.md) for additional checks. The PRs above
are the public references for the reported performance results and limitations.

## Roadmap

We are refactoring module boundaries and state ownership while preserving
loop-level scheduling and KV semantics. See [RFC #32](https://github.com/hsliuustc0106/vllm-rlt/issues/32)
for the target architecture, module breakdown, and implementation sequence.
